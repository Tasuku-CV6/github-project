## Projects

Here are some of the projects I’ve developed that showcase my skills in web development and my commitment to creating user-friendly applications.

### Project Title: Make Your Move (Adidas)

A website that I worked on with an image slideshow to highlight the best parts of working for the Adidas company and I focused on creating a linear feel to the storytelling experience for the website. Lastly the webstie itself is fully responsive and highlights my experience as a web developer.
